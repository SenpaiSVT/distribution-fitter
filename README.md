# Distribution Fitter

A Python-based data analysis tool for fitting probability distributions to datasets and
visualizing the results. This project was developed as part of my first-year engineering
coursework at the University of Waterloo.

## Overview
This project takes numerical data as input and fits common probability distributions
to help analyze trends and underlying behavior in the data. The goal was to practice
data handling, visualization, and statistical reasoning using Python.

## Features
- Fits multiple probability distributions to a dataset
- Visualizes fitted distributions using clear, labeled plots
- Supports comparison between different distribution models
- Emphasizes readable code and interpretable results

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy (if applicable — remove if you didn’t use it)

## What I Learned
- How to clean and preprocess raw numerical data
- How to visualize data effectively using Python
- How distribution choice affects interpretation of results
- Writing modular, readable analysis code

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SenpaiSVT/<repo-name>.git
2. pip install numpy matplotlib
3. Run python main.py
